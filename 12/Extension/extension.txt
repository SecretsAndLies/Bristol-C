==HOW TO PLAY==
Run this with:
make ext_run
Use the right arrow to rotate right. 
Use the forward arrow to go forward.
Press Q to quit (you must press this or "END" will not be generated).
Change the turtle colour with 'W' for white, 'G' for green,
'M' for magenta etc.

==OPTIMIZER==
I also implemented an optimizer. This takes the output and 
converts it into a more compressed form, for example 
taking RIGHT 5 RIGHT 5 and turning it into RIGHT 10.

==SOURCES==
I referenced an SDL game tutorial, but it ended up being
easier to use your code and the documentation.
