This extension uses a better algorithm (backtracking)
and visualizes the results.

first utilized the code from https://github.com/csnwc/Exercises-In-C/tree/f3803259aa6a0bfc210d6bf07c8d7e578bde9333/Code/Week5/SDL
as starter code for understanding SDL.

It generates the solutions using the previous code,
and if the -visualize flag is set, 
then displays one board every 2 seconds graphically. 

The queen is pixel art using three rectangles.

I also use a recursive backtracking algorithm to generate
my solution. Note: I was heaviliy inspired by 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/n-queen-problem-backtracking-3/
and other resources that discussed backtracking in this exact problem
however, my solution is adapted to use my existing solutions array
rather than returning a boolean.
